# Weather Dashboard
This is a server side API app that uses 'OpenWeather One Call API' to provide you with 
current weather as well as a 5 day forecast. 

## usage 
Type a city into the search bar to get that cities current Temperature, Wind Speed, Humidity and UV index that is color coded.
Along with the current weather you will be provided with a 5 day forecast. Your searches will be stored locally and displayed to you
so you can click on them and re-view that city.
